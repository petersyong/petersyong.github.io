After graduating from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities College of Biological Sciences in 2020 with a B.S. in Biochemsitry, I moved to San Diego to work on HIV/SARS-CoV2 vaccine design at the Scripps Research Institute under Dr. Raiees Andrabi. Here, we leveraged next generation sequencing to search for broadly neutralizing antibodies. Ultimately, characterization of these antibodies including structural studies/epitope mapping have been used to guide vaccine design. 

In March of 2022, I left my position at Scripps Research for my current position at a Series A biotech startup based in Los Angeles. I am excited to share more when allowed, as we are currently in stealth mode. 

Outside of the lab, I enjoy skiing, tennis, and concerts. You can also regularly find me exploring Asian restaurants in San Gabriel Valley or Sawtelle. One of my favorite activities is playing spike-ball at one of the beautiful beaches of Southern California.
