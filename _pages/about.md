Hi I'm Peter!

After graduating from the University of Minnesota in 2020, I moved to San Diego to work on HIV/SARS-CoV2 vaccine design at the Scripps Research Institute. Here, we leveraged next generation sequencing to search for broadly neutralizing antibodies. Ultimately, characterization of these antibodies have been used to guide vaccine design and other therapeutics. 

In March of 2022 I joined Rampart Biosciences, a startup working on developing a novel gene therapy platform. 

In the summer of 2023 I will be matriculating to a MSTP to pursue my MD/PhD. I am excited to be able to share which school I am attending soon!

Outside of the lab, I enjoy skiing, tennis, and concerts. You can also regularly find me exploring restaurants in San Gabriel Valley or Sawtelle. One of my favorite activities is playing spike-ball at one of the beautiful beaches of Southern California.
