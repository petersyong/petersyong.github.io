Hi, I'm Peter.
After graduating from the University of Minnesota in 2020, I moved to San Diego to work on HIV/SARS-CoV2 vaccine design at the Scripps Research Institute. Here, we leveraged next generation sequencing to search for broadly neutralizing antibodies. Ultimately, characterization of these antibodies have been used to guide vaccine design and other therapeutics. In March of 2022 I joined Rampart Biosciences, a startup working on developing a novel gene therapy platform. 

In the June of 2023 I started as a first year medical student at the University of Washington's MSTP to pursue my MD/PhD.

I am interested in leveraging computational biology to help develop cancer immunotherapies.
